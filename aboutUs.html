        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>2007–2010: Start-up phase
Flipkart was founded in October 2007 in Bengaluru[12] by Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal, alumni of the IIT Delhi and former Amazon employees.[13][14][15] The company was started from a two-bedroom apartment in Koramangala, Bengaluru.

This space was otherwise only shared by very limited number of players at that time in the market, such as Landmark and Infibeam. Flipkart used aggressive discounts and focused on customer service to move towards a leadership position in the market. WeRead consisted of a large network of readers (~3 million) with around 60 million books. The platform also noted information that was user generated – such as people marking a book as favorite or leaving a review or rating.

        <p>On 4 May 2018, it was reported that multinational retail conglomerate Walmart had won a bidding war with Amazon to acquire a majority stake in Flipkart for US$15 billion.[107][108] On 9 May 2018, Walmart officially announced its intent to acquire a 77% controlling stake in Flipkart for US$16 billion.[109] Following the purchase, Flipkart co-founder Sachin Bansal left the company. The remaining management team reported to Marc Lore, CEO of Walmart eCommerce US.[110] Walmart president Doug McMillon cited plans to help Flipkart with its sourcing and supply chain while tapping on its expertise to expand Walmart globally.[111] Indian traders protested against the deal, considering it a threat to domestic business.[112][113]

In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on 11 May 2018, Walmart stated that a condition of the deal prescribed the possibility that Flipkart's current minority shareholders "may require Flipkart to effect an initial public offering following the fourth anniversary of the closing of the transactions at a valuation no less than that paid by Walmart".[114][115]

Following the announcement of Walmart's deal, eBay announced that it would sell its stake in Flipkart back to the company for approximately US$1.1 billion and relaunch its Indian operations. The company stated that "there is a huge growth potential for e-commerce in India and significant opportunity for multiple players to succeed in India's diverse, domestic market."[54] Softbank Group also sold its entire 20% stake to Walmart without disclosing the terms of the sale.[116] Walmart's acquisition of a 77% stake in Flipkart was completed on 18 August 2018.
